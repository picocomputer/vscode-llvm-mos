# RP6502 VSCode Scaffolding for LLVM-MOS

This is scaffolding for a new Picocomputer 6502 software project.

### LLVM PATH notes

LLVM-MOS must be in your PATH. However, this may conflict with other LLVM
installations, like the one that comes with your operating system.
In that case, you can adjust the path for only CMake with a VSCode setting.
Add a file `.vscode/settings.json` with the following contents. Adjust the
path for where you installed LLVM-MOS.
```
{
    "cmake.environment": {
        "PATH": "~/llvm-mos/bin:${env:PATH}"
    }
}
```

### Linux Tools Install:
 * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This has its own installer.
 * An install of [LLVM-MOS](https://llvm-mos.org/wiki/Welcome).
   See PATH notes above.
 * The following tools installed from your package manager:
    * `sudo apt-get install cmake python3 pip git build-essential`
    * `pip install pyserial`

### Windows Tools Install:
 * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This has its own installer.
 * An install of [LLVM-MOS](https://llvm-mos.org/wiki/Welcome).
   See PATH notes above.
 * Install python by typing `python3` which will launch the Microsoft Store
   where you start the install. If python runs, this has already been done,
   exit python with Ctrl-Z plus Return.
 * Install the python serial library with `pip install pyserial`.
 * `winget install -e --id Kitware.CMake`.
 * `winget install -e --id GnuWin32.Make`.
    Add "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin" to your path.
 * `winget install -e --id Git.Git`.

### Getting Started:
Go to the [GitHub template](https://github.com/picocomputer/vscode-llvm-mos)
and select "Use this template" then "Create a new repository". GitHub will
make a clean project for you to start with. Then you can download the
repository and open the files.

```
$ git clone [path_to_github]
$ cd [to_where_it_cloned]
$ code .
```

Install the extensions and choose the default or obvious choice if VSCode
prompts you. Choose "[Unspecified]" for the CMake kit.

"Start Debugging" (F5) will build your project and upload it to the
Picocomputer over a USB cable plugged into the Pico VGA. There is no debugger
for the 6502; this process will exit immediately after the upload.
If the default communications device doesn't work, edit ".rp6502" in the
project root folder. This file will be created the first time you
"Start Debugging" and will be ignored by git.

Edit CMakeLists.txt to add new source and asset files. It's
pretty normal C/ASM development from here on.
